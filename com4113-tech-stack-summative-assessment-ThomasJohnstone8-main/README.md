# Choice of tech stack

identify and discuss yur choice of tech stack for devloping this project

In this project I have decided to use various programming tools to reach the desired goal of the assingment brief. To achieve this, i have used HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Firstly, HTML is used as the front end of the website and controls how to website is structured. Next, CSS applys the styling and presentation, this help with the design and overall look of the website. Lastly JavaScript adds interactivity to the website, allowing moving images, sticky headers, functional searching and much more. Together these are the powerhouse of Web Development and are core technologies used in most real life scenarios. With this, it makes learning HTML CSS and JavaScript practical seen as its used a lot in the web. Furthermore, with it being quite a well known profession there are many libraries and frameworks that can assist you whhen making website, these examples include Bootstrap for CSS and React for JavaScript.
